Thank you for using the BrainChip MetaTF deployment block from Edge Impulse Studio. This folder contains an FBZ model that is compatible to deploy on a BrainChip AKD1000. Please visit https://doc.brainchipinc.com/ for more information on how to use this FBZ file.

If your Impulse contains DSP functions you may see the included C++ SDK to understand how to build an application that can use the DSP functions and pass to an Akida model.

If your Impulse learning block enabled one of the "Akida Edge Learning options" then please note that your FBZ is now edge learning enabled. Please visit BrainChip's documentation on how to use Edge Learning models: https://doc.brainchipinc.com/user_guide/akida.html#id1
